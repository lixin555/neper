@node Raster Tessellation File (@file{.tesr})
@section Raster Tessellation File (@file{.tesr})

Here are details on the @file{.tesr} file format version
@code{2.0}.  Developers should note that read and write functions are
available as @samp{neut_tesr_fscanf} and @samp{neut_tesr_fprintf},
defined in directories @file{neut/neut_tesr/neut_tesr_fscanf}
and
@file{neut/neut_tesr/neut_tesr_fprintf}.
Compared to a tessellation file (@file{.tess}), a raster tessellation
file can include cell morphological properties such as their centroids
or volumes.  This is motivated by the fact that, for a raster tessellation,
these properties are both in small number and relatively expensive to
compute, and so are stored once known.  Square brackets (@code{[ ]}) denote
optional fields.

@node Multiscale Cell File
@section Multiscale Cell File

A multiscale cell file provides cell-by-cell values for a multiscale
tessellation and can be loaded using @samp{msfile(@var{filename})}@footnote{As
of version 3.5.0, @samp{msfile(@var{filename})} should be preferred over
@samp{file(@var{filename})}}.
The file contains, for each cell, its @dfn{multiscale
identifier}, @var{mid}, and the value(s).  A @dfn{cell multiscale
identifier} (@var{mid}) is a character string identifying a cell at a
specific scale.  For a given cell, C, @var{mid} combines the identifiers
of the cells that C belongs to, at successive scales, to its own
@code{id}, separated by @samp{@SEPFRAC{}}.  For a 1-scale tessellation,
@var{mid} equals @var{id}.  For a 2-scale tessellation composed of
@iftex
@math{2@times3}
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@math{2 x 3}
@end ifinfo
cells, the @var{mid}s are equal to @code{1::1},
@code{1::2}, @code{1::3}, @code{2::1}, @code{2::2} and @code{2::3}.
The domain (which can be considered as a cell at scale 0), @var{mid} is nil.
An example of a multiscale cell file that could be used to define the amounts of cells of a 3-scale tessellation is:

@verbatim
2
1 2
2 4
1::1 3
1::2 4
2::1 5
2::2 6
2::3 7
2::4 8
@end verbatim

The file could be used in @code{-T} as: @option{-n msfile(@var{filename})::msfile(@var{filename})::msfile(@var{filename})}.
The first  instance of @samp{msfile(@var{filename})} reads the number of scale-1 cells in line 1,
the second instance of @samp{msfile(@var{filename})} reads the number of scale-2 cells in lines 2--3, and
the third  instance of @samp{msfile(@var{filename})} reads the number of scale-3 cells in lines 4--7.

@node Position File
@section Position File

A position file lists the coordinates of a given number of points.  The
file must contain 1 coordinate per point in 1D, 2 coordinates per point
in 2D and 3 coordinates per point in 3D.  While the dimension can be
known from the context in which the file is read, it can also be
specified by appending @samp{@SEPDEP@var{dim}} to the name of the
position file, where @var{dim} is the dimension.
@w{A coordinate} can be an integer or real number. A real
number can have an arbitrary number of digits, but the decimal mark must
@w{be @samp{.}}.
The coordinates can be separated from each other by spaces, tabulators
or newlines (any number as well as arbitrary combinations of them are
supported).
However, a good practice is to
format the file with one line per point.
An example of a position file containing 5 points in 3D is:

@verbatim
2.1235 9.4544 5.2145
5.9564 3.6884 9.2145
2.2547 3.2658 8.2514
8.2515 9.4157 2.9454
0.5874 4.2848 2.4874
@end verbatim
